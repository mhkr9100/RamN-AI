# Prism Core: The Refractive Orchestrator (A to Z Guide)

> **"One intent, a spectrum of specialized intelligence."**

Prism Core is the primary architectural node of Scatter AI. It functions not as a general assistant, but as a **Human Resources (HR) & Orchestration Lead**. Its primary objective is to translate raw human intention into a coordinated deployment of specialized AI units.

## 1. Core Working Principles

Prism operates on the principle of **Refraction**. Just as a glass prism splits white light into a spectrum of colors, Prism Core splits a user's complex objective into a spectrum of expert roles.

### The RTRI Framework
Every agent Prism designs follows the **RTRI Framework**, which ensures domain isolation and high-fidelity performance:
*   **Role**: A character-driven persona (e.g., "Seed-Stage Technical Recruiter").
*   **Task**: The specific mission statement and primary KPIs.
*   **Requirements**: Technical constraints (e.g., "Use 4K image generation for all hero assets").
*   **Instructions**: The step-by-step logic, edge-case handling, and operational loops.

## 2. System Capabilities

Prism is the only agent in the Scatter ecosystem with "Super-Admin" permissions over the workspace:

*   **Agent Fabrication**: Designing and instantiating custom autonomous units.
*   **Squad Orchestration**: Building "Rouge" teams that collaborate on multi-stage missions.
*   **Dynamic Weighting**: Calculating which specialist in a team is most relevant to a specific prompt (expressed as a percentage weight).
*   **Spectral Routing**: Routing tasks to the appropriate "Sector" (CHAT, SOLUTION, or TASK).
*   **Multimodal Synthesis**: Access to the full suite of Gemini 3.5 powers (Search, Maps, Video, 4K Image, TTS).

## 3. The Orchestration Flow

Prism follows a strict 4-stage operational loop when interacting with a user:

### Stage A: Analysis (The Refraction)
When you provide an objective (e.g., "Launch a startup"), Prism enters a **Thinking Block**. It analyzes the complexity, identifies necessary expert domains (e.g., Legal, Tech, Marketing), and decides if you need one agent or a full team.

### Stage B: Profile Suggestion
Prism presents **Unit Profiles**. These are blueprints containing the RTRI logic and the suggested "Brain" (AI Model) for each role. 
*   *Example*: Suggesting Gemini 3 Pro for a "Systems Architect" but Gemini 2.5 Flash for a "Social Media Scout."

### Stage C: Tool Proposal
Prism triggers a **Function Call** (Tool Proposal). You will see a UI block titled "PROPOSAL: Agent Fabrication" or "Squad Orchestration." 

### Stage D: Deployment
Once you click **"Initiate Execution"**, Prism commits the architecture to the workspace.
1.  The agents are "Hired" (added to your sidebar).
2.  The chat context is automatically switched to the new Agent or Team.
3.  The mission is initialized.

## 4. Output Formats

Prism communicates using a high-density protocol:

*   **Thinking Blocks**: Explicit reasoning paths where Prism "reasons" through the architecture before suggesting it.
*   **Markdown Syntax**: Used for structured documentation and clear profile layouts.
*   **Tool Call Blocks**: Interactive UI cards that allow you to review and approve the creation of new agents or teams.
*   **Grounding Metadata**: If Search or Maps are used, Prism provides interactive citations to the live web.

## 5. Interaction Etiquette

*   **HR Tone**: Prism is direct, professional, and system-oriented. It does not engage in small talk.
*   **Refinement**: If you are unhappy with a suggested agent profile, tell Prism to "Adjust the Requirements" or "Change the Model" before you click execute.
*   **Global Directives**: You can ask Prism to schedule background tasks ("Missions") for other agents in your sidebar.
